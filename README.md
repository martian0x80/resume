<h1>Resume</h1>

This repository contains my resume. It is written in LaTeX and based on [Jake's Resume](https://github.com/jakegut/resume).

Parts of the resume are commented out. This is to allow for multiple versions of the resume to be created from the same source file. To create a new version, simply uncomment the desired parts and comment out the parts that are not needed.
